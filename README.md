## Resources
### Guardian Form Validator
[https://github.com/eisenbraun/guardian](https://github.com/eisenbraun/guardian)

This plugin allows for the validation of forms in a nonobtrusive fashion. I used this plugin on the contact form. 

### ResponsiveSlides
[http://responsiveslides.com/](http://responsiveslides.com/)

ResponsiveSlides provides functionality for an image slideshow that fades between images and content. I used this plugin on the home page to rotate between several banner images.

### Custom jQuery
I implemented a custom jQuery solution for the hamburger menu icon. When the hamburger icon is clicked the menu is either displayed or hidden based on its current state.

### Custom JavaScript
This site has a custom JavaScript functionality that tells a viewer whether or not the restaurant is currently open. This functionality can be viewed in the hours section of the website.

## Comments
I hope the custom JavaScript component gives a glimpse at my programming abilities. Comparing hours isn't bad but once attempting to compare opening/closing not on the hour makes it more challenging.
